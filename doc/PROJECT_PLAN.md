## Engine/Game Play

* Ryan - Primary responsibilities will be on the backend of the Engine, specifically working with some of the objects and their corresponding ObjectData modules (Tower, TowerData, Enemy, EnemyData, etc). I will be working on this with both Katie and Ben. I will also be working with the GameConnector and the TimelineControl, where the backend interacts with the frontend and data is passed in between both sides of the project.My secondary responsibilities will be working on the GameState and GameController classes, which connect all of the backend. 
* Katie - Primary responsibilities include working on the Backend of the Engine, specifically working on the Data Template classes, as well as helping with corresponding ObjectData modules, including the Launcher, Projectiles, and Movable/Intersect classes. 
* Ben - Primary responsibilities include working on the backend of the Engine, specifically on the Listeners for Object Modules and the Objects themselves, such as Towers, Enemy, and associated interfaces.
* Brendan - Primary responsibility includes handling File I/O and parsing Game XML data. Will also work with authoring team to specify file format for parsing/writing current game state.
* Alexi - Primary responsibility includes working on the Frontend of the program, including the Panel and Screen classes, as well as buttons and styling.
* Andrew - Primary responsibility includes working on the Frontend of the program, including Panels, Screens, and Frontend control features/interfaces with the Backend.
